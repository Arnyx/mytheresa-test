## ⚙️ Installation & Execution

⚠️ **Important:** Copy the content of `.env.template` to `.env` and update it with:

- Your TMDB API key (if you want to work with TheMovieDb datasource)
- The `DATASOURCE` variable:
  - `TMDB` → Fetch movies from TheMovieDB API
  - `LOCAL` → Use local mock data

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run locally
npm run dev

# Run tests
npm run test

# View test coverage
npm run test:coverage
```

## 🔍 Technical Decisions

- **Clean Architecture on the backed**:
  - Separation of concerns between `domain`, `infrastructure`, and `presentation`.
  - Use of **Factories** for dynamic datasource selection (`TMDB` or `LOCAL`).
- **Screaming Architecture on the frontend**:
  - Organizes code by **features** instead of technical layers for better maintainability.
  - Groups related components, hooks, and styles under the same feature folder (e.g., `Movies`, `MovieDetails`).
- **SSR with streaming**: Implemented with React 18 + Vite middleware.
- **Styling**: SCSS for flexibility and BEM methodology.

## ✅ Future Improvements

- Add more integration tests.
- Improve accessibility (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation).
- Add more info to the details page.
- Improve overall look and feel.
